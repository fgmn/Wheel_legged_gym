# Isaac Gym Environments for Wheel Legged Robots #
## Overview

This is my undergraduate thesis project, focused on the design of a wheel-legged robot controller using reinforcement learning to adapt to complex terrains. It references the [leggedrobotics/legged_gym](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/legged_gym) project.



## Environment Setup

Refer to the original repository for detailed instructions on environment setup.
